   - Returns structured data for AI analysis
   - Status: **WORKING**

2. **Core Architecture**
   - Queue/ticket system functioning
   - Hybrid AI routing (GPT-4o + Claude) implemented
   - Industry detection working
   - Knowledge base integration complete
   - User verification system active

3. **First AI Response**

   - Example: "Oh man, I totally get it - body contouring lead generation is brutal right now..."

### ‚ùå Issues Found

1. **AI Model Configuration**
   - Claude models failing with 404 errors
   - Need to verify API key has access to Claude Sonnet 4
   - Currently falling back to GPT-4o successfully
   - Some responses reverting to generic fallback

2. **Conversation Persistence**
   - After first good response, subsequent messages get generic replies
   - Likely due to model switching/failing mid-conversation

### üìä Quality Metrics

From quick test:
- Scraping Success Rate: 100%
- First Response Quality: EXCELLENT (595 chars, industry-specific)
- Follow-up Response Quality: POOR (generic 69 char fallback)

## Key Insights

### What's Working Well

- Knowledge bases are comprehensive with real competitor data
- SLO strategy and ROAS education integrated
- User verification distinguishing owners vs competitors

### What Needs Fixing
1. **API Configuration**: Verify Claude API access and correct model names
2. **Error Handling**: Improve fallback to maintain conversation quality
3. **Response Consistency**: Ensure all responses provide value, not generic fallbacks

## Recommendations
