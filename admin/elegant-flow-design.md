### Interaction Patterns:
- **Enter** advances to next step
- **Tab** moves between fields
- **Auto-save** every keystroke

## Why This Flow Works

### Psychological Principles:
1. **Commitment & Consistency** - Small steps build commitment
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Not overwhelming
3. **Narrative Arc** - Tells a story
4. **Accomplishment** - Each step feels like progress

### Business Logic:
1. **Offer First** - Can't qualify without knowing what you sell
2. **Value Before Price** - Justify the cost
3. **Risk Reversal** - Remove objections
4. **Urgency Last** - After value is clear

### Technical Benefits:
1. **Linear data flow** - Each step uses previous data
2. **Easy to test** - Can A/B test individual steps
3. **Clear analytics** - See exactly where people stop
4. **AI improvements** - Each step can be optimized

## The Code Structure

```typescript
const configuratorSteps = [
  {
    id: 'dream-outcome',
    title: 'Dream Outcome',
    component: DreamOutcomeStep,
    validation: (data) => data.dreamOutcome.length > 10,
    aiSuggestions: true
  },
  {
    id: 'value-stack',
    title: 'Value Stack',
    component: ValueStackStep,
    dependsOn: ['dream-outcome'],
    validation: (data) => data.valueStack.length >= 3
  },
  {
    id: 'pricing',
    title: 'Set Price',
    component: PricingStep,
    dependsOn: ['value-stack'],
    autoCalculate: true
  },
  // ... etc
]

// Can only proceed if dependencies are met
const canProceed = (currentStep) => {
  return currentStep.dependsOn.every(dep => 
    steps.find(s => s.id === dep).complete
  )
}
```

## The Experience

### For Users:
"This is the easiest offer builder I've ever used. It just flows."

### For Conversion:

- Higher quality output (focused thinking)

### For Us:
- Clear data structure
- Easy to optimize each step
- Perfect for AI enhancement
- Natural upsell points

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Simplify Current Configurator
- Hide tabs, show one at a time
- Add step numbers
- Create linear flow

### Phase 2: Enhance with AI
- Add suggestions at each step
- Auto-fill based on website analysis
- Predictive completions

### Phase 3: Full Intelligence

- Recommend optimizations
- Compare to successful offers

## The Bottom Line

**Simple is sophisticated.**

By forcing linear, step-by-step progress:
- Users don't get overwhelmed
- Each step builds perfectly
- The outcome is always better
- Completion rates skyrocket

This isn't dumbing down.
This is smart design.
This is how billion-dollar products are built.
