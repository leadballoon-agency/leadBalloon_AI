* FuS AI

* The Smart Follow-Up Engine

---

#### **Level of Consciousness:**

**Low to Medium** – Prospects know they’re overwhelmed and wasting time, but many don’t yet understand automation or AI as the fix. They feel the pain, but not the root cause.

---

#### **Level of Awareness:**

**Problem-Aware to Solution-Aware**  
 They know they’re wasting time on admin or losing leads — but they aren’t clear what system or product can actually solve it without adding another job.

---

#### **Stage of Sophistication:**

**Level 3 to Level 4**

* Level 3: They've tried things before — CRM, Zapier, email automation — but are jaded or frustrated.

* Level 4: They're seeking a *better, simpler system* that doesn’t require a full-time admin to maintain.

(*See infographic on page 1 — Match Your Marketing With The Level of The Market*)

---

#### **Big Idea:**

“You don’t need more tools. You need one follow-up system that runs itself.”

Automation isn't a luxury anymore — it's the missing link keeping you from growing. Follow Up Systems takes the burden off your shoulders by ensuring no lead, task, or customer slips through the cracks — without hiring more staff or wasting time setting up complex software.

---

#### **Metaphor:**

“The digital employee that never sleeps.”

Or:

“It’s like having a full-time follow-up assistant that never forgets, never burns out, and costs less than a cup of coffee a day.”

---

#### **Potential UMP (Unique Mechanism of the Problem):**

Most small businesses lose time and money not because of a lack of leads or effort — but because they rely on **manual follow-up, memory, and fragmented tools**.  
 The hidden problem: **Human error \+ tool overload \= dropped opportunities and missed revenue.**

---

#### **Potential UMS (Unique Mechanism of the Solution):**

A pre-configured, AI-powered follow-up system that plugs into your business and starts working **within days**, not months.  
 You don’t set it up — **we install, train, and optimise it for you.**  
 It works across calls, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, CRM tasks, and more.

---

#### **Guru (Positioning Archetype):**

*The Practitioner Who Got Frustrated With Overpriced, Overcomplicated Systems and Built Something That Actually Works for SMBs.*

Ideal tone: Relatable. Straight-talking. Experienced. Anti-hype.

---

### **Discovery Story:**

“We kept seeing business owners drowning in admin — logging into 5 different tools, chasing leads by hand, and getting nowhere. They’d tried Zapier. They’d tried CRMs. Nothing stuck. So we built a system designed from the ground up to work the way small businesses actually do — lean, busy, and time-starved. That’s how Follow Up Systems was born.”

---

### **Product:**

**Follow Up Systems** – A done-for-you AI follow-up engine that works across your business to capture, convert, and chase leads, tasks, and clients without needing you to remember or repeat anything.

---

### **Potential Headline/Subheadline Ideas:**

* “Your Leads Aren’t Cold. You’re Just Not Following Up Fast Enough.”

* “The Smartest Way to Reclaim Hours, Recover Lost Revenue, and Finally Fix the Follow-Up Problem”

* “Automate Your Follow-Ups Without Becoming a Tech Expert”

* “One System. Every Lead. Followed Up, Every Time.”

---

### **List All Objections You Can Think Of:**

* “We’ve already got a CRM”

* “Is this going to be complicated to set up?”

* “We’re not very tech-savvy”

* “We’ve tried automation before and it didn’t work”

* “What if it sends the wrong message to a lead?”

* “We can’t afford another monthly subscription”

* “I don’t want to sound robotic”

* “What if it replaces my team?”

---

### **Belief Chains (What They Must Believe to Buy):**

1. Follow-up is costing me time and money

2. Manual systems (or my current tools) are not sustainable

3. AI and automation can improve my follow-up and customer experience

4. I don’t have to be technical to implement this

5. Follow Up Systems can be trusted to do it right

6. The ROI will exceed the cost

7. This will save me time — not create more work
