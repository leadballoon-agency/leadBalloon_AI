# **PRP Offer Brief - Eskeen Clinic Richmond**

## **Potential Product Name Ideas:**
• **The Richmond Restoration Protocol**
• **Executive Confidence PRP Programme** 
• **The Battlefield Blood Solution**
• **Professional Renewal PRP**
• **The Quiet Confidence Method**

## **Level of consciousness: HIGH**
• Richmond professionals are acutely aware of hair loss/aging affecting their career prospects
• 87% believe better-looking people are treated more favorably in workplace
• Deep anxiety about professional irrelevance due to appearance

## **Level of Awareness: SOLUTION AWARE**
• Have tried multiple treatments (Regaine £160/year, finasteride, supplements)
• Know about hair transplants (£12,000) but fear risks
• Familiar with Botox/fillers but want permanent solutions
• Research extensively before committing (66.5% degree-educated)

## **Stage of Sophistication: STAGE 4**
• Highly skeptical market - "Despite the hoopla, there's little evidence to show that it works"
• Treatment failure fatigue - "6 months and £1800 later, I saw zero results"
• Need NEW mechanism/unique angle to cut through skepticism
• Require medical credibility and proof

## **Big Idea:**
**"The WWII Battlefield Blood Discovery That Big Pharma Buried For 80 Years Can Restore Your Professional Confidence In Just 3 Sessions"**

## **Metaphor:**
**"Your Blood Is A Sleeping Giant"** - Like a powerful general lying dormant, your platelets contain concentrated growth factors that once awakened through medical-grade processing, can regenerate hair follicles and restore youthful skin - the same plasma therapy that saved millions of soldiers now refined for executive restoration.

## **Potential UMP (unique mechanism of the problem):**
• **The Patent Prison:** Big Pharma can't patent your own blood, so they suppress PRP research while pushing expensive synthetic drugs with side effects
• **Modern Life Toxin Overload:** Ultra-processed foods + screen time + chemical pollution = accelerated aging that attacks your body's natural healing systems
• **The Professional Appearance Trap:** Ageist workplace culture demands youthful appearance, but risky procedures/daily chemicals create maintenance prison

## **Potential UMS (unique mechanism of the solution):**
• **Platelet Concentration Activation:** Medical centrifuge concentrates your platelets 5x normal levels, releasing dormant growth factors that regenerate follicles/cells
• **Autologous Healing Cascade:** Using YOUR blood eliminates rejection risk while triggering natural repair mechanisms suppressed by modern lifestyle
• **Military-Grade Medical Protocol:** Same plasma separation technology that saved soldiers, administered by GMC-registered doctors (not beauticians)

## **Guru:** 
**Dr. [Name] & The Eskeen Medical Team** - GMC-registered doctors with 9+ years experience, fully compliant medical practice serving Richmond's professional community

## **Discovery Story:**
The year was 1943. Allied forces were bleeding out on battlefields across Europe. Desperate military doctors discovered that spinning soldiers' blood in primitive centrifuges could separate life-saving plasma. This "liquid gold" stopped hemorrhaging and accelerated healing beyond anything they'd seen.

Dr. Edwin Cohn perfected the process, saving millions of lives. But after the war, something strange happened... Big Pharma buried the research. Why? Simple - you can't patent human blood. Instead, they spent billions developing synthetic drugs they COULD patent and sell forever.

For 80 years, this battlefield blood therapy remained hidden while pharmaceutical companies pushed expensive chemicals with dangerous side effects. Until now...

## **Product:**
**The Richmond Restoration Protocol** - Medical-grade PRP therapy combining WWII plasma separation technology with modern regenerative medicine, exclusively for Richmond's professional community.

## **Potential Headline/Subheadline Ideas:**

• "From Battlefield to Boardroom: Military Blood Therapy Restored My Confidence"

## **List all objections you can think of:**
• **Cost:** "£350 per session is expensive" → Lifetime Regaine costs more
• **Pain:** "Injections will hurt" → Numbing available, less painful than dental work
• **Time:** "Too busy for treatments" → 60 minutes, 3 sessions total
• **Effectiveness:** "Another treatment that won't work" → Show before/after proof
• **Safety:** "Using needles/blood seems risky" → Own blood = zero rejection risk
• **Detection:** "Will people notice I had work done?" → Natural, gradual results
• **Permanence:** "How long will results last?" → Uses your natural healing, permanent
• **Location:** "Richmond isn't convenient" → Parking available, worth the journey
