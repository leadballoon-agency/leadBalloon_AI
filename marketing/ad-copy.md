Their agency charges them £10,000/month to manage it.

We analyzed their ads (took 3 minutes).

Extracted their entire funnel.
Created a better offer.

Total cost: £0 (Facebook Ads Library is free)

Now imagine having AI that does this automatically...
And creates BETTER offers than their agency.

That's LeadBalloon AI.

💰 Their agency: £10,000/month
🚀 LeadBalloon AI: £497 once

Which would you choose?
```

### Hook 3: The Agency Secret
```
Dirty secret agencies don't want you to know:

All their "winning" ads are public.
Facebook Ads Library shows EVERYTHING.
• Their copy formulas

• How long ads have been running (longer = profitable!)

Agencies charge £5k-10k/month for this "expertise"...
But it's all visible for FREE.

LeadBalloon AI extracts it all in seconds.
Then creates offers that beat them.

🔍 We reverse-engineer what works
🤖 AI builds you something better
💰 You save 95% vs agency fees

### Hook 5: Case Study Angle
```
How Skulpt Body Contouring beat CoolSculpting
(using their own strategy against them):

Step 1: Found 23 CoolSculpting Facebook ads
Step 2: Noticed they NEVER mention skin tightening (weakness!)
Step 3: Saw their price point: £2,000-4,000
Step 4: Found their guarantee: "See results"

Our AI created this counter-offer:
✅ Emphasized skin tightening (their weakness)
✅ Priced at £697 (massive undercut)
✅ Stronger guarantee: "Visible results in 30 days or DOUBLE money back"
✅ Added urgency: "Only 5 spots" (machine capacity = real scarcity)

Result: 3.4x conversion rate increase

Subject: Found your competitor's entire Facebook ad strategy

Hi [Name],

Quick question - did you know [Competitor Name] is running 23 different Facebook ad campaigns right now?

I can see:
• Their exact offers (including pricing)
• Which ads have run longest (the winners)
• Their copy formulas and guarantees
• What they're NOT offering (opportunities)

They're probably paying an agency £5-10k/month for this.

Our AI extracted it all in 3 minutes, then created a better offer that exploits their weaknesses.

Worth a 15-minute demo to see your competitor's playbook?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Facebook Ads Library is public. Agencies hate that we figured this out.

## The Core Story/Pitch

**The "Agency Arbitrage" Narrative:**

"Every day, businesses pay agencies £5,000-£10,000 per month to create and test marketing strategies. These agencies spend months and thousands in ad spend to find what works.

But here's what they don't want you to know: ALL their winning campaigns are visible in Facebook Ads Library. Every ad. Every offer. Every strategy that's working.

If an ad has been running for 6+ months, it's profitable. No business keeps spending on ads that don't work.

LeadBalloon AI automatically:
1. Finds your competitors' ads
2. Extracts their proven strategies  
3. Identifies their weaknesses
4. Creates BETTER offers that beat them

You're essentially getting their £10,000/month agency strategy... for £497.

It's arbitrage, pure and simple. They pay to discover what works. You pay once to use what's already proven."

## Objection Handlers

**"How is this different from just copying?"**
"We don't copy - we improve. Our AI identifies what they're missing (their weaknesses) and creates superior offers. Plus, we use their data to validate what works in your market."

**"Sounds too good to be true"**
"Facebook made all ads public for transparency. We just figured out how to extract intelligence from it. Agencies have been doing this manually for years - we automated it."

**"Why only £497?"**
"Because our cost is near zero. We're not paying copywriters, strategists, or designers. AI does it all using proven templates. We can serve 1,000 clients for the same cost as 1."
